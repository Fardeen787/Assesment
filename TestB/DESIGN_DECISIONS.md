### 2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**

**Decision**: Separate specialized agents for different tasks (interview, knowledge, diagnosis, recommendation).

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a focused responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update individual components
- **Testability**: Can test each agent independently
- **Scalability**: Can add new agents without affecting others

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex coordination required
- Potential for inconsistency between agents
- Higher memory footprint

**Alternative Considered**: Single monolithic agent handling all tasks

### 3. **ChromaDB for Vector Storage**

**Decision**: Use ChromaDB as the vector database for RAG implementation.

**Rationale**:
- **Persistence**: Built-in disk persistence
- **Simplicity**: Easy to set up and use
- **Performance**: Good performance for moderate datasets
- **Features**: Supports metadata filtering

**Trade-offs**:
- Not as scalable as production vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Limited to single-machine deployment
- Less sophisticated indexing options

**Alternative Considered**: In-memory FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate

### 4. **Groq API for LLM Inference**

**Decision**: Default to Groq API with Llama 3.3 70B model.

**Rationale**:
- **Speed**: Extremely fast inference times
- **Cost**: More cost-effective than GPT-4
- **Quality**: Llama 3.3 70B provides excellent results
- **Availability**: Good API availability

**Trade-offs**:
- Less established than OpenAI
- Smaller model selection
- May lack some GPT-4 capabilities

**Alternative Implemented**: Fallback to OpenAI API

### 5. **Pydantic for Data Validation**

**Decision**: Use Pydantic models throughout the application.

**Rationale**:
- **Type Safety**: Runtime type checking
- **Validation**: Automatic input validation
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code
- **Serialization**: Easy JSON conversion

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance overhead for validation
- Additional complexity for simple data
- Learning curve for advanced features

**Alternative Considered**: Python dataclasses, dictionaries

### 6. **Async/Await Pattern**

**Decision**: Implement all API calls and long operations as async.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Non-blocking I/O operations
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple consultations
- **User Experience**: Responsive UI
- **Modern**: Aligns with modern Python practices

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex error handling
- Requires understanding of async concepts
- Some libraries don't support async

**Alternative Considered**: Synchronous implementation with threading

### 7. **Streamlit for UI**

**Decision**: Use Streamlit for the web interface.

**Rationale**:
- **Rapid Development**: Quick to build and iterate
- **Python Native**: No need for separate frontend
- **Good Enough UI**: Sufficient for proof of concept
- **Built-in Features**: Session state, caching, etc.

**Trade-offs**:
- Limited customization options
- Not suitable for production scaling
- Restricted to Streamlit's paradigm
- Less control over UX

**Alternative Considered**: FastAPI + React, Flask + JavaScript

### 8. **Hybrid Search Strategy**

**Decision**: Combine vector similarity with metadata filtering.

**Rationale**:
- **Accuracy**: Better results than vector-only search
- **Flexibility**: Can filter by severity, age group, etc.
- **Performance**: Reduces search space
- **Relevance**: More contextually appropriate results

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex implementation
- Requires careful metadata design
- Potential for over-filtering

**Alternative Considered**: Pure vector similarity search

### 9. **Fallback Mechanisms**

**Decision**: Implement fallbacks for API failures and parsing errors.

**Rationale**:
- **Reliability**: System continues functioning
- **User Experience**: No abrupt failures
- **Demonstration**: Works even without external APIs
- **Debugging**: Easier to identify issues

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional code complexity
- May mask real issues
- Fallback quality may be lower

**Alternative Considered**: Fail-fast approach

### 10. **Comprehensive Logging**

**Decision**: Extensive logging throughout the application.

**Rationale**:
- **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot issues
- **Monitoring**: Track system performance
- **Audit Trail**: Medical applications need trails
- **Development**: Helpful during development

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance impact
- Storage requirements
- Potential security concerns
- Log noise

**Alternative Considered**: Minimal logging, external monitoring
