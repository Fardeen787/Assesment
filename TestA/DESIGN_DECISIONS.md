# Design Decisions and Trade-offs

## Overview

This document explains the key design decisions made in developing the Medical Records API and the trade-offs considered for each choice.

## 1. Technology Stack Decisions

### FastAPI vs Flask/Django

**Decision**: FastAPI

**Rationale**:
- Modern async support for better performance
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Built-in request validation with Pydantic
- Type hints integration for better code quality
- Native OAuth2 support

**Trade-offs**:
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Django
- Less mature than Flask
- Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with async

### SQLAlchemy ORM vs Raw SQL

**Decision**: SQLAlchemy ORM

**Rationale**:
- Database agnostic (easy to switch between SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Protection against SQL injection
- Easier relationship management
- Migration support with Alembic

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance overhead for complex queries
- Learning curve for ORM patterns
- Less control over exact SQL generated

### JWT Authentication vs Session-based

**Decision**: JWT with OAuth2

**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication (better for scaling)
- Standard OAuth2 flow compatibility
- No server-side session storage needed
- Works well with mobile/SPA clients

**Trade-offs**:
- Cannot revoke tokens before expiry
- Larger request size (token in header)
- Token refresh complexity

## 2. Security Architecture Decisions

### Field-level Encryption vs Full Database Encryption

**Decision**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data

**Rationale**:
- Granular control over what's encrypted
- Better performance (only encrypt sensitive fields)
- Allows searching on non-encrypted fields
- Meets HIPAA requirements for PHI protection

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex implementation
- Cannot search on encrypted fields
- Key management complexity

### Fernet vs AES/RSA

**Decision**: Fernet (symmetric encryption)

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation
- Good security with authenticated encryption
- Built-in timestamp validation
- Part of cryptography library (well-maintained)

**Trade-offs**:
- Single key for encryption/decryption
- No public key infrastructure
- Less flexible than raw AES

### Role-based vs Attribute-based Access Control

**Decision**: Role-based (RBAC) with fixed roles

**Rationale**:
- Simpler to implement and understand
- Covers typical healthcare scenarios
- Easier to audit and maintain
- Clear permission boundaries

**Trade-offs**:
- Less flexible than ABAC
- Difficult to handle edge cases
- May need permission expansion later

## 3. Data Storage Decisions

### SQLite vs PostgreSQL for Development

**Decision**: SQLite with PostgreSQL compatibility

**Rationale**:
- Zero configuration for development
- Easy testing and CI/CD
- Same SQLAlchemy interface
- Simple migration to PostgreSQL

**Trade-offs**:
- No concurrent writes in SQLite
- Some PostgreSQL features unavailable
- Different performance characteristics

### Normalized vs Denormalized Schema

**Decision**: Normalized (3NF) schema

**Rationale**:
- Data integrity and consistency
- Reduced data redundancy
- Easier updates
- Clear relationships

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex queries with joins
- Potential performance impact
- May need views for reporting

## 4. Search Implementation Decisions

### In-memory vs Vector Database

**Decision**: In-memory with vector database interface

**Rationale**:
- Faster initial development
- No external dependencies
- Easy to test
- Clear upgrade path to ChromaDB

**Trade-offs**:
- Not suitable for production scale
- No persistence
- Limited search capabilities
- No distributed search

### Simple Matching vs ML Embeddings

**Decision**: Keyword matching (with embedding interface ready)

**Rationale**:
- Immediate functionality
- No model deployment needed
- Predictable results
- Lower computational requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- No semantic understanding
- Misses related concepts
- Lower search quality
- Requires exact term matches

## 5. API Design Decisions

### RESTful vs GraphQL

**Decision**: RESTful API

**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for healthcare APIs
- Simpler caching strategies
- Better tooling support
- Easier integration for clients

**Trade-offs**:
- Over/under fetching issues
- Multiple requests for related data
- Less flexible queries

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Processing

**Decision**: Async endpoints with sync database operations

**Rationale**:
- Better request handling performance
- Non-blocking I/O
- Future-ready for async database drivers
- Good balance of complexity/performance

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex error handling
- Debugging challenges
- Team learning curve

## 6. Testing Strategy Decisions

### Unit + Integration vs E2E Only

**Decision**: Comprehensive unit tests + integration tests

**Rationale**:
- Fast feedback loop
- Easier to pinpoint failures
- Better coverage
- CI/CD friendly

**Trade-offs**:
- More test code to maintain
- Potential test duplication
- Longer initial development

### Real Database vs Mocks

**Decision**: Test database for integration tests

**Rationale**:
- Tests real SQL behavior
- Catches ORM issues
- More realistic testing
- Same setup as development

**Trade-offs**:
- Slower test execution
- Database cleanup complexity
- Can't test database failures easily

## 7. Audit Logging Decisions

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous Logging

**Decision**: Synchronous database logging

**Rationale**:
- Guaranteed audit trail
- Simpler implementation
- Immediate consistency
- Easier debugging

**Trade-offs**:
- Performance impact on requests
- Database dependency for logging
- No buffering for spikes

### Structured vs Free-form Logs

**Decision**: Structured logs with JSON metadata

**Rationale**:
- Easier querying and analysis
- Consistent format
- Machine-readable
- Flexible additional data

**Trade-offs**:
- Larger storage requirements
- Schema evolution challenges
- More complex queries

## 8. Error Handling Decisions

### Generic vs Detailed Error Messages

**Decision**: Balanced approach with environment awareness

**Rationale**:
- Security through obscurity in production
- Helpful errors in development
- Consistent error format
- Proper status codes

**Trade-offs**:
- Debugging complexity in production
- Potential information leakage
- Client-side error handling complexity

## Summary

These design decisions prioritize:

1. **Security**: HIPAA compliance and data protection
2. **Maintainability**: Clean code structure and testing
3. **Scalability**: Upgrade paths for all components
4. **Developer Experience**: Good documentation and tooling
5. **Performance**: Async handling where beneficial

The architecture is designed to start simple but scale up as needed, with clear migration paths for all components that might need upgrading (database, search, caching, etc.).
